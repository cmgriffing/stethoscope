<h1 align="center">ðŸ©º Stethoscope</h1>
<p align="center">Use this extension to get a quick pulse check on any repos you are considering using.</p>
<hr />

## Usage

Stethoscope is fairly easy to use. We use a set of criteria to judge the repo using only what is available on the repo's root page.
*There are plans to add further functionality using github login and the API.*

### Steps

1. Navigate to a repo of your choice.
2. Observe the icon change in your extension par if you have it pinned.
3. Green is great. Red indicates failure.
4. Use your extension manager button to open the popup modal for more details.

### Criteria

It is **important** to note that missing some of these is not a huge problem. They add up in total to more than 100% of a possible score. So, one missing can still allow a perfect grade.

- Has License file or section in the README. It is an immediate fail if no license is found.

- Stars count being above 100.
- Has Readme file.
- Most recent commit. Scaled to within a year. 1 year ago being a 0 and now being a 20.
- Amount of contributors being greater than 5.
- Amount of commits.
- Has a sponsors section.
- Has a releases section
- Has docs folder.
- Frequency of commits for root level files and folders. Checks amount of time between most recent and oldest. Also checks for varied dates between and ratio of unique commits.
- Open issues relative to star count or commit count, whichever is greater.
